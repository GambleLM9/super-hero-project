Captain: Jacob R.
Frontend Developer: Ola A.
Backend Developer: Martin M.

## Problems encountered:

Day 1: Martin's computer took a bit to properly connect to the github.
Day 2: Major issue with ejs files(FIXED!), and mongoDB not working at all at the end.
Day 3: MongoDB caused more issues, resolving issues failed, by sheer miracle by god we fixed it.

# WORK DONE:

### Martin
Day 1: After initial computer issues, finished Server.js. Took over the `js` file in `public` folder for Ola.
Day 2: After initial team troubleshooting, I integrated MongoDB to the server. And spent the rest of the day trying to fix it.
Day 3: Removed the mongoDB, fixed gramatical errors and smaller issues.
